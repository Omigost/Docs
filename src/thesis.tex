    \section{Overview}

    Cloud computing has become recently one of the most important paradigm shifts
    in the area of real world software engineering.
    It has reshaped the whole process of how applications are developed
    and reduced the amount of upfront
    investment required to start an internet business.
    While commercial cloud computing services were first offered
    in 2006 by Amazon Inc, the original idea and preliminary
    implementation traces back to Multics OS developed by MIT,
    GE and Bell Labs.
    However the idea of time-sharing systems that was the ancestor of a cloud
    concept was widespread in 60ies~\cite{Markus}.

    The term “Cloud computing” can refer to every layer of application stack:
    hardware, hosting platform, software and even to a single function.
    Cloud computing refers to both the applications delivered as services over the Internet and
    the hardware and systems software in the data centers that provide these services.
    The services themselves have long been referred to
    as Software as a Service (SaaS)~\cite{Armbrust}.
    Generally speaking cloud can be perceived as a shared pool
    of computer resources such as computing capacity,
    transient and persistent memory, which can be acquired or released on demand.
    The undisputed power of cloud computing constitutes
    in its elasticity and granularity: it allows users
    to ask for hundreds of computers for only 5 minute usage which
    are shipped during several minutes.
    Such services are usually offered over remote network connection and users are billed
    for the portion of the resources they have used.
    Depending on the cloud infrastructure type the payment models
    can be different~\cite{Laatikainen},
    but the common spendings are associated with data storage,
    data transfer, and computing timeshare.

    Nowadays the industry increasingly relies on cloud technologies.
    More and more companies start or move their products to cloud environment.
    Unfortunately it comes with additional financial costs imposed by cloud providers.
    In order to make business profitable, companies try
    to reduce amont of money they are supposed to pay to the minimum.
    Despite different solutions, like employing specific
    cloud cost optimization team, more and more firms decide
    to benefit from dedicated software, which is supposed to help
    manage and optimize their cloud usage.
    It is not easy to choose the right tool having that many choices.

    There are some notable solutions of AWS cloud optimization
    problem -- \textit{AWS Cost Explorer} and \textit{AWS Cost Management},
    \textit{Cloudability}, \textit{Apptio} and others widely used nowadays.
    In spite of that fact there is still place for new tools targeting
    omitted types of clients or wrapping and bundling the greatest features from exisiting ones.

    \section{Aim of the thesis}

    The primary objective of the thesis is to create a tool
    complementing existing solutions used in cloud cost optimisation.
    We focus on Amazon Web Services platform maintained by Amazon
    as it is one of the most commonly used.
    In our tool, called \textit{Omigost}, we will try to target small/middle
    sized companies creating simple and easy to use software
    with flexible configuration options.

    \section{Structure of the thesis}

    The thesis is structured as follows.
    In Chapter 2 we describe the problem of cloud cost optimization
    with additional description of selected existing solutions.
    In Chapter 3 we write about our development process -- the tools and techniques
    we used to efficiently communicate and coordinate with people involved in the project
    and successfully deliver the product.
    Then, in Chapter 4 we present our solution in detail.
    We mention, among others, whole system architecture, API and configuration.
    Finally, in Chapter 5 we sum up the whole thesis.
    In Appendix A we describe how to introduce our solution in a company.

    % \subsection{Cloud resources}
    %
    % Cloud computing has introduced 3 new aspects which are
    % radically different from a traditional
    % computing paradigm in terms of hardware infrastructure.
    % The availability of practically infinite on demand computing resources,
    % which allows users to deploy applications without any kind of resource planning.
    % The elimination of massive initial financial commitment,
    % therefore allowing small companies to increase
    % their hardware usage proportional to their needs.
    % The ability to granularly allocate computing resources on any kind of timeframe
    % (from minutes up to days etc.), as well as the ability
    % to release them as there is no more need.
    %
    % Depending on the service offered by the provider
    % we differentiate 3 main models of cloud computing:
    %
    % \begin{enumerate}
    %     \item Infrastructure as a service (IAAS).
    %     \item Platform as a service (PAAS).
    %     \item Software as a service(SAAS).
    % \end{enumerate}
    %
    % \subsection{IAAS -- Infrastructure as a service}
    %
    % In such form of service, the provider allocates
    % an instance of virtual machine for the client
    % and ensures that minimal building blocks for the IT infrastructure are present:
    % network, storage, computing capacity, load balancer, VLAN etc.
    % Usually providers of such services run pools of hypervisors
    % such as Xen, VMware, QEMU etc which host and manage
    % those virtual machines.
    % From the user perspective
    % it usually looks like a command line interface
    % through which user has full control over the allocated
    % virtual machine.
    % Some of the well known
    % services are Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine, Microsoft Azure IAAS.
    %
    % \subsection{PAAS -- Platform as a service}
    %
    % Platform as a service alleviates the need for the developers
    % to manage the operating system and
    % provides programming language specific execution environment
    % as well as the underlying structure
    % (hardware, network, storage etc).
    % This adds another layer of convenience over IAAS making the deployment
    % and the development of applications much more fluent process.
    % While users benefit from the automatic software maintenance,
    % OS security patches etc, they also lose full control
    % over the virtual machine instances.
    % AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Heroku
    % and Google App Engine are some of the most popular PAAS services.
    %
    % \subsection{SAAS -- Software as a service}
    %
    % This form of service takes control of every layer
    % of application and the user has nothing to do with
    % the underlying infrastructure.
    % This is by all means one of the most popular form of cloud computing as
    % it might not require any kind of technical background to be used.
    % Examples of SAAS services are Google
    % Cloud Vision, Google Docs, Microsoft Office 365.

    \chapter{Problem statement}

    \section{Motivation}

    As there are plenty of various billing models for cloud services~\cite{Laatikainen},
    the effective management of them became a tough problem.
    The ease of resource allocation led to situation when tracking tiniest details of billings
    is an unaffordable challenge.

    However, according to our client, some businesses they are in contact with
    (as well as theirs) reported a demand for a tool that would provide budgeting management
    and basic machine termination automation.
    Such tool may not cover as many use cases as the tools
    available on the market, but it would allow for huge savings while
    also being simple in implementation and maintenance.
    The tooling that exists is targetting wideworld-scale companies
    that are able to require expensive licenses and hire cost-optimization teams.

    This is a demand in the small-to-medium business market that our solution,
    \textit{Omigost}, attempts to cover.
    Having one versatile tool removes the need for using few detached pieces of software.
    The most important aspects of our tool are intuitive interface and different types
    of user notifications, which highly increase spendings clarity
    and help in decisions related to costs cutting.
    We hope it will allow companies to focus more on providing value to their clients
    and having significantly lower costs in the same time without having to spend resources
    on extensive toolkit for cost optimization.
    This should be possible to achieve with budget and machine termination solutions
    that are very simple in concept and implementation, but provide great savings.

    During the designing process of Omigost, we decided to dedicate our
    focus on providing a solution with the following features:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Free and Open Source
        \item Easy cloud management without complex knowledge
        \item Intuitive interface for individual workers to request resources
        \item Notifications for cost surpassing and redundant resources
        \item Proper notification management -- only significant alerts
        \item Integration with communication via Slack
    \end{itemize}

    \section{Overview of exisiting solutions}

    Businesses that rely upon cloud services often reach a point where resources
    they are using up gradually become less and less manageable.
    As the problem is well known to the cloud market, both Amazon
    and other third-party companies made attempts to fulfill these needs
    by creating custom software implementing various AWS expense optimization approaches
    that include:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Budget limit configuration, alerting users when those are exceeded
        \item Instance alerting management
        \item Cost analytics
    \end{enumerate}

    Some of the most prominent tools currently available
    on the market that improve resource management experience
    for AWS cloud are described in the following sections.
    Every description is supposed to show key features crucial for cost optimization.

    \subsection{AWS Budgets}

    AWS Budgets \cite{AWSDocs} is a part of Amazon Web Services that allows
    to limit how many resources of a certain type are used on AWS
    throughout a selected period of time (i.e. every month).
    AWS enables their users to specify the scope of such a budget in detail.
    For example, one may make a budget only consider costs of those machines
    that are either tagged in a specific way
    or are owned by a certain group of accounts.

    When a limit is either exceeded, close to be exceeded or is forecasted
    to exceed the configured threshold before the end of that period,
    a preconfigured action takes place.
    For such an occasion, the administrator can either choose
    to have email notifications sent out to a list of addresses
    or have Amazon's Simple Notification System (SNS) triggered.
    SNS provides the AWS users a way to implement custom notification flows.

    Types of resources one can put this kind of a budget on include:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Money spent in total or on a certain type of machines
        \item Utilisation of selected services
        \item Utilisation or coverage of reserved instances
    \end{enumerate}

    \subsection{AWS Cost Explorer and AWS Cost Management}

    AWS Cost Explorer \cite{CostExplorer} enables access to all budget data.
    User can define and generate custom reports in a form
    of a data chart spanning a selected time interval
    with chosen time granularity of the samples.
    % https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/
    AWS Cost Explorer is also a basis for AWS Cost Management,
    which is basically a set of predefined reports
    that form an easily accessible dashboard.
    % https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/

    \subsection{Cloudability}

    Atlassian's Cloudability \cite{Cloudability} delivers
    a budget system functionality analogous to AWS Budgets
    along with tools for predicting future spendings
    and presenting the real cost of AWS resources in utilisation.
    In comparison to Amazon's native tools, Cloudability
    also allows management of multiple accounts in the same time.
    It saves effort of having to set up budgets separately in every owned account.

    \subsection{Apptio}

    Apptio \cite{Apptio} provides a set of tools that mainly focuses on analysis
    of expenses and their forecasts,
    managing them collaboratively and planning future ones.
    They expose features that make it easier to discover underutilized resource,
    compare spendings with a database of similar benchmarks,
    organize resources into groups to make reports even clearer,
    and offer other useful management utilities.

    \subsection{Stax.io}

    Stax.io's \cite{Stax.io} main focus is to provide insight about cost,
    wastage, compliance and cloud quality.
    It can analyse how cloud resources are used, measure quality of the way cloud is utilized,
    set up checks for business-compliance of a cloud with several standards
    and give customized advice on what could be optimized to reduce wastage,
    while also allowing for creation of custom views of data.
    Basic tools for budgeting instances, accounts, tags and more, monthly or annually,
    and configuring overspend alerts are also available there.

    \subsection{SnowSoftware}

    SnowSoftware's toolset, alongside fulfilling some of the more specific usecases
    like optimizing usage of software from SAP Software Solutions or optimizing
    and managing software licenses,
    also has tools that are dedicated to optimizing cloud costs.

    Snow for SaaS attempts to give a holistic view about application usage
    including, among others, how SaaS applications are used
    on cloud and whether there are zombie virtual machines~\cite{SnowSaaS}.

    Snow Automation Platform suggests approach based on automated
    and preconfigured provision of resources.
    By pre-giving those resources a decommission date one can avoid issue of zombie instances.
    It is also possible to preconfigure budgets and schedule machine starts
    and stops to further optimize costs~\cite{SnowBlog}.

    \section{Conclusions}

    After a lecture and research of those resources publicly available on the Internet
    that describe above-mentioned AWS optimization solutions,
    we concluded that many of the competing tools
    available on the market don't target simpler usecases that could
    cover needs of multiple small-to-medium businesses that rely on AWS cloud,
    but often rather focus on delivering multifaceted and highly configurable systems.
    These tools also often require costly subscriptions and time spent on maintaining
    the configuration.

    Our research failed to find a tool that would fill this demand.
    Many of them fail to provide both instance budgeting and machine termination automation.
    A number of them also put most of their emphasis on analysing usage data rather than
    helping with instance management.

    According to our research, from tools listed in section 2.2, Snow Automation Platform
    is the only system that features both budgeting and automating
    machine termination and stopping.
    However, it's approach is not to straightforwardly manage already existing machines,
    but rather to automate their provisioning.

    Cloudability~\cite{CloudabilityAlerts} offers simple alerts, but they lack
    Slack (team collaboration toolkit, communication service) support
    and beforementioned propagation abilities.

    In some cases the software, as it is in case of Cloudability, is too complex
    for an average user and does not provide an easy way
    to incorporate custom business flows into the tool.

    Amazon, as one of the leading cloud providers,
    offers different tools for exploration of expenses.
    Most commonly used options are either their public APIs~\cite{AWSCostManagement}
    or specific SDKs supporting lots of languages.
    Unfortuantely those tools are rather simple and do not satisfy
    all of the needs of potential clients.

    \newpage
    \section{Our solution}

    Omigost is an app that focuses on two main features:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item easily manageable AWS Budgets
        \item automatic machine termination
    \end{enumerate}

    as well as uses Slack integration as a convenient and not overly intrusive mean
    of providing employees a simplified way of saving company's money in their day-to-day work.

    TODO a little more of the overview of the app and its business cases

    TODO idea - how about moving this to beginning
    of Chapter 4 (new section), then swapping Chapters 3 and 4?

    \chapter{Project development}

    In this section we describe the way we developed
    the application -- management and organization of work along with supporting tools.

    \section{Version control}

    During development as our version control system we use Git
    and whole code repository is hosted on GitHub.
    We have chosen this particular service because of a few reasons.

    First of all GitHub \cite{GitHub} is one of the most popular Git hosting services
    and also has one of the largest open source communities.
    This is quite important, especially when considering a possibility of
    future development of the tool after finishing this thesis.

    The second reason is integration with lots of useful applications.
    It is easy to use it with different services that improve the development
    process like TravisCI \cite{TravisCI} and Slack \cite{Slack}.

    Last but not least, GitHub has a built in issue tracker.
    It can be highly customised and makes project management easier.
    We created dashboard divided into a few sections, which separate tasks
    in different stages of development.
    Everything is automated -- depending on actions performed by users
    like merging Pull Requests (PRs), issues are moved between sections.
    In order to help prioritize tasks we employed GitHub's issue tagging system.

    \section{Continuous Integration}

    For Continuous Integration we use hosted service -- TravisCI.
    It allows us to make sure new changes we introduce
    are compliant with the rest of our codebase.
    There are two reasons we have chosen this service:
    it is easy to configure using only one YAML file
    inside repository and it is free for open source projects.
    After every code submission, at the beginning TravisCI
    performs Smoke Tests trying to build the project
    and check whether it runs or not.
    Successful build is followed by both backend and frontend tests.

    \section{Communication}

    All of the communication happens via Slack.
    It is a convenient collaboration platform allowing team members
    to communicate efficiently.
    Everybody can create their own instance of a Slack workspace and then
    invite other members to join and use it.
    Various channels can be created there,
    with persistent message history both public and private.
    There is also possibility to reach out to any member directly whenever needed.
    Today Slack is one of the most popular options for groups of any kind to coordinate
    their teamwork on a daily basis.
    We use Slack because it is free, it integrates easily with GitHub and it allows
    us to test Omigost integration with Slack.

    \section{Organization of work}

    We work in iterations that last around one month.
    At the beginning we define and create new issues.
    During the iteration everyone chooses desirable task,
    completes it and makes corresponding Pull Request in GitHub.
    At the end we discuss our overall progress and plan next steps.

    In order to let a new feature become part of the repository it has to be accepted.
    It means that Pull Request has to pass Continuous Integration
    system build and be approved by one of the reviewers.
    Every issue is solved in a separate branch and every PR
    is merged directly to the master branch, which allows us
    to group all commits that are part of one feature or issue.

    \section{Contact with the client company -- Sumo Logic}

    The whole project and the thesis are developed under Sumo Logic mentorship.
    There is one particular person designated to act as mentor -- Jacek Migdał.
    He makes sure we are provided with every resource we need to
    work on the project without unnecessary breaks.
    Also our mentor helps revolve any ambiguity and gives technical advice.

    Day to day communication with mentor takes place via Slack.
    Additionally approximately twice a month our team meets
    in Sumo Logic office to review current progress and overcome major difficulties.
    Every new feature is discussed beforehand with the company.

    \chapter{Tool for AWS cost optimization}

    In this chapter we will describe the whole application -- \textit{Omigost}.

    \section{Use cases}

    In this section you can find descriptions of the most common use cases
    grouped by actors.
    Every use case assumes company is already
    preconfigured in AWS Organizations.

    \subsection{Actor -- AWS cost optimization admin}

    Admin is a person designed to have an access to AWS Cost Optimization platform.
    Most of the interactions happen throught application website.

    First of all admin can configure users inside the application.
    There are following possible actions using configuration tab:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Adding employee
        \item Adding contact to employee (currently only Slack)
        \item Linking account to specific employee
        \item Defining timeframe for machines termination suggestions
    \end{enumerate}
    It is important to mention that most of the similar
    actions like editing and deleting are possible.

    Despite configuration admin can have insight into AWS
    costs looking at dashboards with charts.
    It is also possible to customize charts to show only subset of costs.

    \subsection{Actor -- Employee}
    An ordinary employee does not have access to the platform itself.
    Most of the interactions happen through Slack.
    There are a few situations when a user can receive Slack message from an application bot:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Surpassing a budget
        \item Budget is forecasted to being surpassed
        \item Machine on AWS works in specific timeframe
    \end{enumerate}

    If any of the budgets linked to the employee's accounts are surpassed,
    the employee will receive notification.
    Additionally, if a budget has a machine tag filter configured,
    account owners of those machines that surpass that budget will be notified.

    Messages sent by the bot are rather simple.
    They consist of the title, a button and description that includes
    information about a triggered budget.
    Clicking the button redirects to a dedicated form website on our frontend
    which allows the employee to request more money from the manager.

    \bigskip

    We can imagine example scenario:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A budget is being surpassed
        \item The employee receives message from the bot on Slack
        \item The employee analyzes the description
        \item The employee decides to request more money and clicks the button
        \item The employee is redirected to the request form website
        \item The employee completes and submits the request form
    \end{enumerate}

    \bigskip

    The situation with machine termination is very similar.
    If a machine linked to the account owned by the employee
    is found to be running in defined timeframe, a notification will be triggered.
    The message body contains machine description, a stop button and a termination button.
    By clicking one of those buttons the user can conveniently
    stop or terminate the corresponding machine without having
    to enter AWS' dedicated interface for that purpose.


    \section{Overall architecture}
    Our solution is based on an architecture that is visualized on Figure 4.1

    \begin{figure}[!htb]
      \center{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth] {imgs/arch_diagram.png}}
      \caption{\label{fig:arch-diag} Draft diagram of the tool architecture}
    \end{figure}

    The architecture of our tool can be described as a traditional client-server architecture.
    Actors make requests over the HTTP protocol to the system with a web browser
    using the frontend client application
    served by the Omigost server or, alternatively, from any kind of a storage
    service like, for example, Amazon's S3.
    Those requests are then handled by a backend application running on a central server machine.
    During the handling process our application uses both a local instance
    of a PostgreSQL relational database
    and a connection with selected Amazon Web Services via a SDK library.
    Additionally, end users are notified about budget or instance events
    related to their cloud activity through Slack.

    \subsection{Role of AWS cloud services}
    Connecting with Amazon's cloud services not only allows the application
    to access machines and spending data,
    but many of them also solve many of the problems we would otherwise have
    to solve ourselves -- resulting
    in time saved and a codebase that is more concise and easier to maintain.

    Services that are used in the project and their respective roles in it are as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Identity and Access Management (IAM) -- provision of the main
          Amazon account ID that is used in other services
        \item Organizations -- insight into structure of the Organization
          used by the company, including listing accounts
        \item Budgets -- service keeping eye on spendings that triggers
          a SNS notification whenever a budget limit is or is going to be exceeded
        \item SNS -- alert notifications for backend that let it know about spendings events
        \item Cost Explorer -- data for graph visualizing spendings in frontend
        \item EC2/RDS -- information about state of instances running on the account
    \end{itemize}

    TODO at the end of the project -- check if any other
    "sublibraries" were used and/or if any other use cases emerged

    \subsection{Backend}

    Backend is the main agent of our application's functionalities.
    It is responsible for fetching or receiving data from either
    of other connected resources, parsing it and taking appropriate actions.
    Some of its more important tasks include:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item receiving SNS budget alert notifications
          and notifying appropriate users via Slack,
        \begin{itemize}
            \item providing single use tokens and links
              for non-admin users to be able to request budget limit increases,
        \end{itemize}
        \item fetching and providing raw data for the frontend
          so it can be displayed to the user,
        \item receiving configuration or data modification requests
          and adjusting the application environment components to fulfill them,
        \item checking machine state on preconfigured times
          and notifying users about possible instance optimizations.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Frontend}
    Frontend is a web application that allows the user to see
    and alter the state of the application using a graphical user interface (GUI).
    Its main roles are to:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item request and parse raw data from backend into visual representations of it,
        \item provide an interface for the user,
        \item translate the interface clicks to appropriate backend requests
          and display the results of these requests.
    \end{itemize}

    \section{Technology stack}

    \subsection{Frontend}

    Frontend was written in Typescript \cite{Typescript} using React \cite{React} framework.
    Typescript offers both great flexibility and type safety compared to vanilla Javascript.
    It is the most common alternative to Javascript,
    supported by large bussiness insitutions like Microsoft.
    We decided that other alternatives,
    i.e Reason (or other functional languages compiled to Javascript) or Dart are useful,
    but still need development and their interoperability is sometimes very limiting factor.
    All the codebase is lintend using \textit{tslinter}.

    Typescript code is transpiled using \textit{tsc} and bundled by \textit{webpack}.
    We do not use any other build tools like
    \textit{Grunt} or \textit{Gulp} as the backend has its own tooling, i.e Gradle.
    It would just unnecessarly compilicate building process without any gains.
    Frontend build is coordinated by npm plugin for Gradle.

    Frontend codebase is split between universal, reusable components
    and concrete implementation of user views.
    That design decision was an effect of following
    general good programming guidelines.
    It enables future application contributors and users
    to effectively implement customizations or modification
    in existing code without unnecessarly big work efforts.
    The views are split between various \textit{modules}.
    A module is a standalone entity that provides its
    own button in the sidemenu of application.
    For increased customizability and modularity each of them
    can be separately disabled or modified.
    To synchronize the data between separate modules we decided
    to use \textit{Redux} with its Flux architecture.
    That allows us to easily persist the application state
    in the local storage of the browser or elsewhere.
    Redux store is a central storage for information
    about current modules settings but also serves views routing data,
    states of dialogs and notifications.

    We also provided \textit{Jest} test suites
    as well as documentation generated by \textit{tsdoc}.
    We also decided to utilize \textit{Storybook}
    to easily design and visually test frontend components,
    which for users stands for a complement
    rather than an alternative for Jest and the documentation.

    \subsection{Backend}

    Core of the backend is \textit{Java 8}.
    We have selected this programming language because most of us were familiar with it.
    Also this language has huge community and lots of useful libraries and frameworks.

    For creation of the whole backend service we have chosen Spring \cite{Spring} framework.
    It is currently one of the most common choices.
    Spring allows to build web applications imposing usage
    of design patterns like Model-View-Controller and Dependency Injection.
    It helps to keep code easily testable and well organized.
    Additionally it provides various features out of the box,
    which speeds up development process.

    Gradle \cite{Gradle} is responsible for build and dependencies management.
    It is easy to use with various IDEs and has flexible configuration.
    The main competitor of Gradle is Maven so obviously we considered both.
    Gradle turned out to be better in terms of performance and usage convenience.

    For data persistence we have chosen PostgreSQL database.
    Relational database enforces having strictly defined data model with validation.
    Performance is not an important aspect for us
    so there was no need for other types of databases.
    PostgreSQL is a great open source database with strong data integrity
    and fault-tolerance guaranties.
    Furthermore, AWS allows setting up PostgreSQL instance with just a few clicks
    with parameters automatically configured for optimal performance.

    In our application we use the following libraries:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Spring Core, Spring Boot, Spring Data, Spring Web,
        \item Project Lombok,
        \item JUnit,
        \item AWS SDKs.
    \end{enumerate}

    \subsection{Deployment}

    The whole tool is bundled up by Docker.
    Following a straightforward instruction everyone is able
    to create their own Docker image of the application.
    Moreover, all of the configuration is present in one file
    making it easy to adapt it your way.

    A preferable method of deployment is to use AWS Elastic Beanstalk with Docker image.
    In such a way AWS will be responsible for almost everything
    including capacity provisioning, load balancing and auto-scaling.


    \section{Communication integration}
    The application is designed for two groups of users: the employees and the administrators.
    While the frontend interface we describe in chapter 4.3.1 is created mainly for the usage
    of administrators, interaction between the system and the employees is mostly
    taken care via Slack.

    Slack apps offer many customization and extension options, but to cover needs of Omigost
    users we mainly relied on a bot feature.

    \subsection{Setup and configuration}

    Basically, to be able to use Omigost with Slack, first of all the administrator has
    to install an Omigost Slack app, choosing from a range of other apps
    available on Slack's app page.
    Alternatively, it is possible to set up the app on one's own
    in a Slack collaboration workspace.
    As a result an Omigost bot capable of messaging users is added to the workspace.
    The administrator is then also provided with an API token that can be entered in
    the main Omigost server configuration for it to be able
    to connect with that bot.
    The administrator should then provide Slack usernames in attached
    workspace for each user in a dedicated configuration panel.
    He also configures who among those users should be considered an administrator
    so the system can also notify him.

    \subsection{Messaging details}

    The integration itself is made possible thanks to the REST API
    that Slack exposes for each instance of our Slack app.
    Every time our app needs to message a user, it issues HTTP
    calls that specify the message content, potential attachments and destination.

    To allow interactions with the system, messages issued by Omigost can contain either links
    or actions.
    We use links to route users to forms that they can fulfill to provide additional
    info to the system.
    The forms use short-lived, single-use generated tokens for identifying
    correlation between form payload and an event that this payload responds to.

    \subsection{Slack message use cases}

    The Slack bot sends notification to the users when they cross
    a predefined budget or leave instances running after the business hours.

    Budget notification flow is as follows: on an event of the system detecting
    either forecasting or detecting a budget overflow, the system collects
    a list of users responsible for machines that are related to that budget.
    To each of those users we send a message that contains actual or potential
    budget overflow details as well as a button link to a form where that user can request
    an increase to the budget limit.
    Responding via such a form results in the system notifying administrators
    about a new limit increase request so they can then decide whether to comply
    with the request, and then act accordingly.

    Machine termination is suggested to users with messages when bussiness hours of a day
    are nearing to an end.
    The messages tell the user how many machines are running at the moment
    and provides a set of actions that enable the user to conveniently stop
    or terminate them.
    After a successful teardown the user is also notified with a "Done!" message.

    The implementation of the machine termination communication has certain subtleties.
    Comparing to budget messages, the application doesn’t keep track of messages
    related to machine termination, but
    only tracks the timestamps of the last time a person was notified via any channel.
    This allows us to limit the number of notifications and not spam the user.

    As the communication is asynchronous between application and the end user,
    we do not rely on immediate response.
    Instead, we bundle the message with the encrypted user AWS id
    and the timestamp of the notification.
    We also keep the encryption keys in the databases for the other instances
    of the application to be able to handle any request.
    The key-timestamp pairs help us identify the user, implement action timeout
    and make sure that nobody from outside can stop the application on behalf of the users.
    Such architecture helps us keep the application stateless
    and increases the overall security of the system.

    \section{Service termination architecture}
    While developing the application, we kept a certain model
    of organization of resources in mind,
    which the enterprise user might have in the AWS cloud.
    A common way of keeping an organization in AWS cloud
    is via service called “AWS Organizations” \cite{AWSOrganizations}.
    The service allows to allocate AWS accounts
    with the predefined roles and permissions for every member of organization.
    Such structure also isolates resources from each other
    and lowers the granular control that the root account has on user allocated resources.

    For our application to be able to tweak and monitor every machine
    created by the organization members, every employee of the organization
    needs to create a certain predefined role
    which should have the same name across all accounts.
    The role should have access to all resources that the user wants to be monitored.
    This can be done by a simple script every time a new member joins to the organization.

    Secondly the account, from which the application will be deployed,
    needs to create an AWS IAM user \cite{AWSIAM},
    which will be used by the application to assume
    the roles created by other members of the organization.
    To enable the functionality, the administrator needs
    to give “AssumeRole” permission to the newly created IAM user.

    We recommended to take the following steps to grant the above mentioned permission.



    \begin{enumerate}

    \item Create an IAM group called “AssumesRolesGroup”.
    \item Go to the permissions section of the group.
    \item Create a custom group policy.
    \item Add the following “JSON” to the policy document.

    \begin{lstlisting}[language=json,firstnumber=1]
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": [
            "sts:AssumeRole"
          ],
          "Resource": "*"
        }
      ]
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    \item Add the IAM user to the “AssumesRoleGroup” group.
    \end{enumerate}

    After taking all those steps, you just need to copy
    the AWS keys of that IAM user account
    to the application configuration file and you are good to go.


    \chapter{Summary}
    The purpose of the project was to implement a solution for optimizing cloud costs
    in a typical medium-sized company according to needs reported by Sumologic.
    From two approaches that were suggested by the ordering party,
    we chose one that was more software-focused rather than analytic.

    Development spanned a period of about a half of a year and planning and preparations took us
    a few more months.
    We developed our application in irregular iterations that each of us adjusted
    to their schedule.
    Additionally, we held meetings with our supervisor roughly every 2-3 weeks
    as well as with the contractor when we needed to consult development and requirement details.
    The company expressed a huge interest in the implementation of the project
    as well as further development of it.

    (<TODO>)In the late stage of the development phase our system was tested
    by a sample group of employees at Sumologic, who provided us
    with an additional feedback that allowed us to further improve the product.(</TODO>)

    In the end we built a system focusing on simplifying AWS Budgets management
    and machine termination automation,
    both of which benefit heavily from a Slack integration.

    The product is a web application consisting of Java Spring server
    and Typescript browser frontend.
    The solution is deployed along a Postgres relational database with a Docker container
    on a Beanstalk instance.
    The project is fully open-source, released under MIT license
    and available on GitHub.
