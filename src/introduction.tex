\subsubsection{Statement of the problem}

The software industry increasing adopt public cloud as the primary method of running their infrastructure.

As the cost of cloud increases, the companies invest in dedicated teams or tools to improve visibility and drive savings. Most of the current solution aims to reduce the cost of production workloads. However, systems for research and development have very different patterns, poorly addressed by existing tools. 

\subsubsection{The solution}

The Omigost is a system that addresses the research and development cost saving use case. We focus on one of the biggest cloud platform - Amazon Web Services, which is managed by Amazon.

The whole system intends not only to provide easy cost insight but also help with basic cost optimization.

On top of collecting and storing AWS data, the system will offer users the following core features:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Interfaces for adjusting dynamic cost limits per user, group or tag
  \item Dynamic alert system for limits exceeding
  \item Customizable alert propagation along management hierarchy tree
  \item Shutdown of redundant running AWS products
  \item Charts useful for cost management
\end{itemize}
