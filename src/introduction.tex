\subsubsection{Statement of the problem}

Nowadays the industry increasingly relies on cloud technologies. More and more companies start or move their products to cloud environment.
It has been observed that gradually institutions introduce dedicated teams for managing the costs of cloud operations or use third-parties for that purpose. Such solutions cause great savings for everyone.
Unfortunately existing toolkit is either very primitive or targets billion dollar companies. Currently neither Amazon nor any third-party offer a tool that would allow flexible, cheap and quick insight into the operation costs for small or middle-sized organizations.

\subsubsection{The solution}

The AWS Cost Optimization Tool is a system that offers reliable solution adressing that issue. We focus on one of the biggest cloud platforms - Amazon Web Services, which is maintained by Amazon.
Whole system intends not only to provide easy cost insight, but also help with basic cost optimization.
Despite collecting and storing AWS data the system will offer users following core features:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Interfaces for adjusting dynamic cost limits per user, group or tag
  \item Dynamic alert system for limits exceeding
  \item Customizable alert propagation along management hierarchy tree
  \item Shutdown of redundant running AWS products
  \item Charts useful for cost management
\end{itemize}
